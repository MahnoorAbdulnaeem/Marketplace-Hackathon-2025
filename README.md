##  Hackathon Progress Overview

### **Day 1: Foundation and Planning**
- Defined the project scope and niche (**Furniture Marketplace**).
- Identified business goals, target audience, and unique differentiators.
- Designed the data schema for key entities:
-  - **Customers**: Store user profiles, preferences, and history.
  - **Products**: Details like name, price, size, color, and stock.
  - **Orders**: Manage statuses and payment tracking.
  - **Delivery Zones**: Serviceable areas and logistics optimization.
  -  [ Day 1 ](https://github.com/MahnoorAbdulnaeem/Marketplace-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/day-1/README.md)


### **Day 2: System Design and Integration**
- Planned the system architecture to connect frontend (Next.js) with backend (Sanity CMS).
- Defined API endpoints for:
  - **GET /products**: Fetch product details.
  - **POST /orders**: Create new orders.
  - **GET /shipment**: Track delivery status.
- Integrated third-party APIs for secure payments and shipment tracking.
-  [ Day 2 ](https://github.com/MahnoorAbdulnaeem/Marketplace-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/day-2/README.md)


###  **Day 3: Slef-Validation API Integration and Data Migration**
- **Integrated APIs** into the Next.js project to manage products, orders, and payments in real-time.
- **Migrated product**, order, and customer data into Sanity CMS, validating and adjusting schemas for compatibility.
- **Ensured robust testing** using Postman and implemented centralized error handling for a seamless user experience.
- Used the **Self-Validation** Checklist to verify the outcomes of Day 1 (business goals and schemas) and Day 2 (technical architecture and workflows).
-  [ Day 3 ](https://github.com/MahnoorAbdulnaeem/Marketplace-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/day-3/README.md)

### **Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components for Your Marketplace**
- **Developed dynamic frontend components** in Next.js to display marketplace data fetched from Sanity CMS and APIs.
- **Created reusable and modular components**, including Product Listing, Product Detail Pages, Cart, and Wishlist.
- **Applied state management techniques using useState** and useContext to handle dynamic data across components.
- **Ensured responsive design using Tailwind CSS**, making the UI mobile-friendly and optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Conducted testing and validation** to ensure all components rendered dynamic data correctly and interacted seamlessly with the backend.
-   [ Day 4 ](https://github.com/MahnoorAbdulnaeem/Marketplace-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/day-4/README.md)

###   **Day 5: Testing, Error Handling, and Backend Integration Refinement**
- **Performed comprehensive functional testing** to validate core features like product listing, cart operations, and search functionality.
- **Implemented robust error handling for API failures**, network issues, and invalid data, ensuring smooth user experience with fallback UI elements and error messages.
- **Optimized performance using tools like Lighthouse and GTmetrix**, including image compression, lazy loading, and JavaScript/CSS optimization to improve page speed.
- **Conducted cross-browser and device testing** to ensure a consistent user experience across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Applied security testing** measures such as input validation, SQL injection protection, and HTTPS enforcement to secure API communication and prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Simulated real-world user interactions** during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to verify smooth workflows for browsing, searching, and checkout.
- **Created a comprehensive testing report** documenting test cases, results, and resolutions, including CSV-based reporting for transparency and clarity.
-    [ Day 5 ](https://github.com/MahnoorAbdulnaeem/Marketplace-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/day-5/README.md)


 ### **Day 6: Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup**
- **Set up a staging environment** using Vercel and Netlify for simulating the production environment before deployment.
- **Performed deployment testing** to ensure all features, including product listing, cart, and user profiles, functioned correctly after deployment.
- **Refined backend integrations** to ensure that APIs and server-side functionalities are working efficiently under load.
- **Validated performance using Lighthouse** and GTmetrix, ensuring optimal page load times and responsiveness across different devices and browsers.
- **Conducted cross-browser and device testing** to guarantee consistent user experience across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Configured environment variables securely** for API keys and sensitive data, ensuring secure communication in the staging environment.
- **Ensured deployment readiness by testing deployment** pipelines and ensuring the staging environment is secure and optimized.
- **Created comprehensive documentation for deployment** steps, environment configuration, and testing results to ensure smooth transition to production.
