# Hackathon Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components for Your Marketplace

## Overview
On **Day 4**, the focus was on building dynamic, scalable, and reusable frontend components for the marketplace. We worked on displaying dynamic data fetched from **APIs** and **Sanity CMS**, ensuring a responsive user experience, and enhancing interactivity through components like product listings, cart, and wishlist.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Product Listing Component**: Dynamically renders product data in a grid layout.
- **Product Detail Pages**: Created individual product pages with dynamic routing to display detailed information.
- **Cart and Wishlist**: Allows users to add products to the cart and save them for future reference.
- **State Management**: Used **useState** and **useContext** for handling dynamic data across components.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled components to be fully responsive using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Additional Features**: 
  - Implemented **pagination** for better product navigation.
  - Added **search filters** to refine product views.
  - Displayed **related products** based on tags or categories.

## Steps Taken
1. **Developed Core Components**:
   - **Product Listing**: Rendered a grid of products dynamically fetched from APIs.
   - **Product Detail Pages**: Set up individual product pages using dynamic routing in **Next.js**.
   - **Cart & Wishlist**: Enabled users to interact with their selected products.
   
2. **Routing Setup**: 
   - Configured **dynamic routing** for product detail pages in **Next.js** to ensure smooth navigation.
   
3. **Responsive UI**: 
   - Styled the UI with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure a mobile-first, responsive design across all devices.
   
4. **State Management**:
   - Managed dynamic data and interactions across components using **useState** and **useContext**.

5. **Testing & Validation**: 
   - Ensured that dynamic data was rendered correctly across components and tested the functionality of each feature.



## Technologies Used
- **React** & **Next.js** for frontend development and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design.
- **Sanity CMS** for managing and fetching product data.
- **useState** and **useContext** for managing component-level and global states.
