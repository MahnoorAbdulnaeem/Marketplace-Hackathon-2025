# Day 3 - Slef-Validation API Integration and Data Migration
Day 3 of the **Marketplace Builder Hackathon** focused on implementing API integration and data migration to create a scalable and functional backend for the marketplace. Validation steps from the **Self-Validation Checklist (Day 1 and Day 2)** ensured alignment between the technical and business foundations of the project.

---

# Objective
**The main goals for Day 3 were:**

- Integrating APIs into the **Next.js** project for real-time product, order, and payment management.
- Migrating data into **Sanity CMS** while validating and adjusting schemas for compatibility.
- Utilizing the **Self-Validation** Checklist to verify business and technical foundations from previous days.


# Key Components
**Frontend**
- Built with Next.js, styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- State management handled by Zustand for efficient and consistent data flow.

# Backend
- Powered by **Sanity CMS** for managing product, order, and customer data.
- API routes designed to manage communication between the frontend and third-party APIs.

 # Third-Party APIs
- Integrated for payment processing and product availability.
- Secured using **API key-based authentication** over HTTPS.

# Tasks Completed
 **API Integration**
 **Implemented API routes for:**
 - **GET** /api/products: Fetching product data.
 - **POST** /api/order: Creating a new order.
 - **GET** /api/order/:id: Retrieving specific order details.
 - **PUT** /api/order/:id: Updating the status of an order.
 - **GET** /api/payment/verify: Verifying payment status.
 - **Tested** APIs using Postman and ensured smooth integration with the frontend.

  # Data Migration
 - Migrated data from provided APIs into **Sanity CMS**.
 -Validated and adjusted schemas to match API field structures.
- Used scripts and manual imports to ensure accuracy and completeness.

 # Self-Validation
 - Used the **Self-Validation Checklist** to confirm:
- **Day 1:** Business goals, market research, and entity relationships were clearly defined.
- **Day 2:** System architecture, workflows, API requirements, and schemas aligned with project objectives.

  # Error Handling:
 - Centralized error logging for debugging.
 - Displayed user-friendly error messages in the frontend.
 - Added fallback mechanisms for better user experience.
 
  # Visual Data Structure
  For Day 3, a system architecture diagram was created to illustrate how components interact:

# Summary
- On Day 3, I successfully:
- **Integrated third-party APIs** for product, order, and payment workflows.
- **Migrated and validated product**, customer, and order data into Sanity CMS.
- **Verified business and technical** foundations using the Self-Validation Checklist.
- **Enhanced the systemâ€™s scalability** and user experience.
